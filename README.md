Georgia Tech VBA/Excel Bootcamp homework - Week 2

File List:

GitJudd_VBAMod.bas includes the entire VBA Module used with the Multiple_year_stock_data.xls This is the full, original module used for the project. 

Based on the submission instructions “VBA Scripts as separate files” I split them up as follows:

sub_clear.bas is the individual script for clearing out all of the generated results across all of the worksheets in the Multiple_year_stock_data.xls workbook.

sub_multisheet.bas is the individual script for running the main script across all of the worksheets.

sub_pleasework.bas is the main script.

Also included 3 screenshots to go with the assignment.
